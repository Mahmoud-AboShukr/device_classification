# Project Notes

## Overview
This file provides additional context for the `Device Price Prediction API` project, including personal insights, areas of challenge, and learning experiences.
I want to acknowledge that while I’m not yet an expert in Java or Spring Boot but I’m enthusiastic about learning and improving my skills in this framework.

## Key Points

### 1. Spring Boot Learning Experience
   - Although I've never worke with java or Spring Boot and I used some opensource implementations alongwith GPT to carry out this task,but it's fair to say that it was
      an excellent opportunity to dive deeper into its capabilities, especially in:
     - Setting up RESTful endpoints.
     - Integrating with external services (FastAPI in this case).
     - Using Spring Data JPA for database interactions.

### 2. FastAPI Integration
   - I chose FastAPI for the prediction microservice due to its ease of use and asynchronous capabilities.
   - Integrating Python and Java services taught me a lot about interoperability and efficient REST API design.
